# KASE-Algorithm
Let us take the case wherein the data in the cloud can be accessed by a group of users and the rest cannot. For the cloud to encrypt the data for individual users in would take a lot of time and computation power. We have devised a algorithm wherein a single key generated using the owner's public key and a randomly generated parameter. Using this method we save a lot of time and the computational power of the cloud. The main advantage of this is as there is a lot of computational power left the cloud can perform other operations as this would increase the efficiency of the cloud.
